<h2>Sans coeur circuit: 2005</h2>
<p>Sans coeur circuit is a playful interactive installation that I co-created during my interactive multimedia profile in collaboration with Sophie Chabot, Olivier Lalonde, and Renaud Granda. In this game, the player must turn off lights by pressing buttons located at the four corners of the game area while avoiding a moving laser.</p>
