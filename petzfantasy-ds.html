<h2>PetzFantasy TM â€“ Nintendo DS-DSi : Ubisoft 2010</h2>
<p>In 2009, I served as the main Game Designer on Petz Fantasy TM, a two-SKU game for the Nintendo DS, featuring Sunshine Magic and Moonlite Magic. The game offers a collection of 40 magical pets that players can train and care for. The pets' magical powers can be honed through various stylus-based minigames, and players must also cater to their pets' needs for food, hygiene, and play.</p>
<p>Working on the first title of a new brand was a rich experience that taught me a lot about branding and international marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Nintendo DS-DSi, Ubisoft, Life Simulation, Fantastic, Stylus</p>
