<h2>Farmerama â€“ Online CMMO : Bigpoint 2013-2015</h2>
<p>From 2013 to 2015, I had the opportunity to serve as the Lead Game Designer on Farmerama, an online CMMO. Leading a team of three talented designers and working with the producer to establish the creative vision and set up the roadmap was a great experience that taught me a lot about the life cycles and monetization strategies of live games.</p>
<p>As the Farmerama team was quite large, I enjoyed working with the other leads to streamline the production pipeline and optimize the workflow in the design team and between the different departments. Overall, working with great people is always a great experience, and Farmerama was the best in that regard!</p>
<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Online CMMO, Simulation</p>
