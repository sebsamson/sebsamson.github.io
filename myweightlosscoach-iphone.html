<h2>My Weight Loss Coach iPod touch/iPhone : Ubisoft 2008</h2>
<p>I served as the Lead Game Designer for the port of the DS game "My Weight Loss Coach" to the iPod Touch/iPhone platform. This game was developed in conjunction with a nutritionist to support users in their weight loss journey by tracking their progress and achievements, helping them improve their energy balance, take control of their weight efficiently, and feel better.</p>

<p>The main challenge of this port was to adapt the pedometer feature of the DS game to the iPhone. Since iPhone applications are downloaded, there was no way to include a physical pedometer. We overcame this by using the motion sensors of the iPhone to create a digital pedometer. However, this posed another problem as using the pedometer required the application to run constantly for a long period, which could quickly drain the iPhone's battery. To overcome this, I developed a new feature to record frequent walk samples that could be added to the daily activity calendar of the application.</p>
