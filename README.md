just my personal website in good old html.

why?
well... after transiting from one website solution to another every 5 years or so since the late 90s I got tired of redoing the formatting of the same pages just to fit the newest web 2.0 gadgets so I decided to get full retro on these glorified ads pushers and redo my portfolio one last time. bonus: it loads much faster.
