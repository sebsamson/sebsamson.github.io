<h2>I Quit (My Stop Smoking Coach with Allen Carr â€“ iPhone) : Ubisoft 2008</h2>
<p>My journey as a Game Designer began with the adaptation of the Nintendo DS game, 'My Stop Smoking Coach with Allen Carr', for the iPod Touch and iPhone platforms. This project marked one of the first ventures of Ubisoft into the mobile gaming world, setting the stage for the smartphone era.</p>

<p>The game, rebranded as 'I Quit' for the iPhone, offers personalized feedback and motivation to help users quit smoking permanently. It's more than just a game; it's an educational tool and a casual companion for those embarking on the journey to quit smoking.</p>
<p><strong>Genre</strong>: iPod touch/iPhone, Education, Casual</p>
