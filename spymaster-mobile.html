<h2>Spymaster â€“ Mobile F2P Strategy : Playraven 2015-2016</h2>
<p>From 2015 to 2016, I had the pleasure of working with a team of veteran game developers at Playraven, a dynamic Helsinki startup, on the reboot of their successful IP, Spymaster. Originally released on iPad as a tabletop single-player strategy game, the Spymaster reboot is a completely different game focused on social and collection aspects, boasting an outstanding visual style.</p>
<p>As the Lead Game Designer on the project, I supported the Game Director and the rest of the team in reinventing this great IP.</p>
<p><strong>Genre</strong>: Mobile, F2P, Strategy</p>
